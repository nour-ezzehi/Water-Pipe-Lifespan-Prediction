# Water Pipe Condition Prediction System
## Project Overview
The Water Pipe Condition Prediction System is an AI-powered solution designed to analyze and assess the state of water pipes based on images. The system predicts the remaining lifespan of water pipes and detects deterioration signs such as cracks, corrosion, and other damages. This predictive model can be deployed in a mobile or web application to assist field technicians in quickly evaluating water pipes' condition on-site.

The model uses computer vision techniques to analyze images of water pipes and provides insights into their quality, potential issues, and necessary maintenance or replacement actions.

## Features
Damage Detection: Identifies cracks, corrosion, and other forms of deterioration in water pipes.
Remaining Lifespan Prediction: Estimates the remaining lifespan of water pipes based on the detected damage.
Mobile/Web Application: Allows field technicians to upload images of water pipes for instant analysis and recommendations.
Lightweight: The model is optimized to work efficiently on mobile devices, ensuring fast and accurate predictions.
Robustness: Designed to handle a variety of lighting conditions and image qualities.
Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a model capable of:

Detecting signs of wear and tear (e.g., cracks, corrosion) in water pipes.
Estimating the remaining lifespan of water pipes.
Providing actionable recommendations for maintenance or replacement based on the analysis.
This system aims to reduce the cost of repairs, prevent unexpected water supply interruptions, and improve the management of urban water infrastructure.

## Technologies Used
Machine Learning/Deep Learning:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
TensorFlow/Keras for model building and training
Programming Languages:
Python
TensorFlow/Keras (for AI and machine learning)
Tools and Libraries:
OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
NumPy and Pandas (for data handling)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
Deployment:
Flask/Django (for web application)
React Native or Flutter (for mobile application)
## Dataset
The model was trained using a dataset of water pipe images. The dataset includes images of water pipes with varying degrees of deterioration (e.g., cracks, corrosion, or general wear). It is important to note that the quality of the images significantly influences the modelâ€™s performance, and efforts were made to ensure the model could handle images with various lighting conditions and angles.
